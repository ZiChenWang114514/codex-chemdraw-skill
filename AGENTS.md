# Repository Instructions

## Scope

Treat `skill/chemdraw/` as the deployable Codex Skill and the source of truth for runtime behavior. Root Markdown is intentionally limited to `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`. Put detailed project guidance in `docs/guide.md` and GitHub-only policy in `.github/`; do not create standalone changelog, support, conduct, notice, or release ledgers when an existing authoritative section or GitHub feature is sufficient. Do not add repository-facing documents inside the deployable Skill.

## Skill Design

- Keep `SKILL.md` concise and route detail to one-level references.
- Preserve the progressive path: metadata -> core rules/router -> workflow/domain guide -> generated signatures -> inventory shards.
- Keep exact MCP signatures generated in `references/mcp-signatures.md`; do not duplicate handwritten signatures elsewhere.
- Preserve existing public tool names unless a documented breaking release is intentional.
- Keep chemistry grounded: do not invent or hand-edit SMILES, do not silently resolve ambiguous OCSR, and do not overwrite source artifacts.
- Keep remote upload opt-in. `confirm_upload=false` must remain the default.

## Changes

- Add or update a failing test before changing behavior.
- Use deterministic parsers/APIs instead of ad hoc text rewriting.
- Keep machine-specific paths, credentials, user data, generated caches, and proprietary test artifacts out of Git.
- Regenerate generated references after changing registry signatures:

```powershell
python .\skill\chemdraw\scripts\generate_tool_reference.py
python .\skill\chemdraw\scripts\audit_toolkit_interfaces.py
```

## Verification

Run portable validation for every change:

```powershell
python .\scripts\validate_distribution.py
```

Run the full suite in a Python environment containing `cdxml-toolkit`:

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s .\skill\chemdraw\scripts -p "test_*.py" -v
.\skill\chemdraw\scripts\health_check.ps1 -SkipNativeChemDraw
```

For native or Office changes, also validate with an activated ChemDraw installation, native PNG rendering, and open/render checks for DOCX/PPTX outputs. Never report those gates as passed when they were skipped.
