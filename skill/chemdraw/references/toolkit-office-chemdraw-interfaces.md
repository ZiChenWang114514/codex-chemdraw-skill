# ChemDraw And Office

## When To Load

Load for CDX/CDXML conversion, native rendering, ChemScript operations, editable Office extraction/embedding, or placeholder templates.

## Preferred Entry Points

- Convert one file: MCP `convert_cdx_cdxml`.
- Native render: MCP `render_to_png` or `render_cdxml_files`.
- Extract editable Office objects: MCP `extract_cdxml_from_office`. Extraction validates every object in a staging directory and publishes the directory only when all objects succeed.
- Inspect objects before targeted edits: MCP `inspect_chemdraw_objects_in_office`. It binds each stable object ID to the source SHA-256, host XML, OLE relationship, embedding part, preview relationship, host position, and geometry, then emits numbered CDXML and optional PNG previews.
- Replace selected objects without moving them: MCP `replace_chemdraw_objects_in_office`. It replaces the selected ChemDraw OLE and linked EMF preview at their existing package paths while preserving host XML, relationship IDs, order, geometry, and all unselected parts.
- Create a new Office file with one editable object: MCP `embed_cdxml_in_office`; it rejects existing Office targets.
- Create a PPTX/DOCX collection: MCP `batch_embed_cdxml_in_office`.
- Fill a template manifest: MCP `fill_office_template`.
- Inspect the installed ChemScript API: MCP `inspect_chemscript_sdk`.
- Run an audited SDK operation sequence: MCP `execute_chemscript_sdk`.
- Python conversion: `chemdraw.cdx_converter.convert_file` or `batch_convert_files`.
- Python rendering: `chemdraw.cdxml_to_image.cdxml_to_image`.

## Inputs And Outputs

CDXML is the editable interchange format. Native rendering supports PNG and SVG by extension. Office outputs are PPTX/DOCX packages with ChemDraw OLE data and EMF previews. Inspection manifests use `schema_version=1` and record the source SHA-256 plus stable object IDs. A replacement manifest supplies the same source SHA-256 and a `replacements` list whose entries contain an object ID and a relative replacement CDXML path. Template and replacement references are preflighted from the manifest directory; absolute paths and traversal outside that boundary are rejected.

All ChemDraw, Word, and PowerPoint automation runs through an ASCII-only native workspace. Unicode source and destination paths remain supported because Python copies validated inputs into that workspace and publishes validated outputs back through the existing no-overwrite transaction. This applies to CDX/CDXML conversion, PNG/SVG rendering, inspection previews, CDX/EMF embedding, template filling, replacement, and Office PDF export. Do not bypass this bridge by passing user paths directly to toolkit COM helpers.

## Failure Modes

ChemDraw COM may fail when registration is missing, documents are locked, unsupported CDXML is opened, or Python bitness selects a different registered automation server than the interactive installation. Office conversion must fail if any required input is missing or if generated OLE data, package relationships, or requested object counts are incomplete. Selective replacement also rejects source-hash drift, duplicate or unknown IDs, missing preview relationships, unsafe paths, existing outputs, and failed Office PDF export; staged outputs are rolled back together. Never replace editable OLE with a flat image without explicit permission.

## Supporting APIs

- `chemdraw.chemscript_bridge.ChemScriptBridge`: properties, conversion, cleanup, MCS, overlay, and reaction loading.
- `office.ole_extractor.extract_from_office`: batch OOXML extraction.
- `office.ole_embedder`: batch conversion, content sizing, compound-file construction, PPTX/DOCX builders.
- `office.doc_from_template`: manifest loading and two-pass text/OLE replacement.
- `chemdraw.cdxml_to_image_rdkit`: simple-molecule diagnostic fallback only.

### ChemScript SDK Coverage

`inspect_chemscript_sdk` reflects the managed assembly selected by the local ChemScript configuration. The result distinguishes two measurements:

- `catalog_percent`: every SDK-declared public type, constructor, method overload, property, field, and event has a record.
- `execution_path_percent`: every ordinary public SDK member has a matching declarative operation.

The current local ChemScript 22.0 assembly reports 85 public types and 3029 public members; these values are runtime evidence and may differ with another ChemDraw release. Do not hard-code them in callers. Generated SWIG pointer, `HandleRef`, and `IntPtr` members remain in the catalog as `interop_infrastructure`. Their explicit isolated-process option is for SDK auditing only and may terminate the worker if the caller supplies an invalid native address.

`execute_chemscript_sdk` accepts only `construct`, `call_static`, `call`, `get`, `set`, `get_index`, `set_index`, `iterate`, `dispose`, and `release`. Results can be named with `as` and referenced later with `{"$ref": "name"}`. Typed arguments support enums, byte arrays, arrays, default values, and, when separately enabled, `IntPtr`/`HandleRef`. There is no Python expression evaluation.

File readers/writers and `LoadFile`/`ReadFile`/`WriteFile` require `allow_file_io=true`. Existing file replacement additionally requires `allow_overwrite=true`. The runtime loads the configured assembly name dynamically, so APIs such as `LargestCommonSubstructure.Compute` do not depend on a version-specific `CambridgeSoft.ChemScript16` import.

## Do Not Use Directly

Do not call `_chemscript_server` commands, construct CFB/OLE bytes ad hoc, or claim full GUI automation. Do not use RDKit fallback as the final fidelity check for reactions or Office output. Catalog coverage does not mean that every SDK overload has been chemically validated with every possible input; inspect outputs and use real fixtures for the intended operation.
