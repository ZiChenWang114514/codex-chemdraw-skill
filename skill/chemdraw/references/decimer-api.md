# DECIMER 2 API Reference

Verified against the live service and official sources on 2026-07-11.

## Two Different APIs

### DECIMER 2.8.0 Python API

The official PyPI package exposes a local Python function:

```python
from DECIMER import predict_SMILES

smiles = predict_SMILES(
    image_input="structure.png",
    confidence=False,
    hand_drawn=False,
)
```

Signature:

```text
predict_SMILES(image_input, confidence=False, hand_drawn=False) -> str
```

`image_input` accepts an image path or NumPy array. This is a local inference API and requires the DECIMER model archives. It is not an HTTP call.

Official sources:

- Package: https://pypi.org/project/decimer/
- Function documentation: https://decimer-image-transformer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/DECIMER.html

### Remote Steinbeck Lab API

Use this endpoint for online recognition:

```text
POST https://api.naturalproducts.net/latest/ocsr/process-upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Accept: application/json
```

Multipart fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `file` | binary image | yes | Chemical structure depiction image |
| `hand_drawn` | boolean text | no | `true` for sketches; default `false` |

No authentication scheme is declared by the current OpenAPI document.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "https://api.naturalproducts.net/latest/ocsr/process-upload" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -F "file=@structure.png;type=image/png" \
  -F "hand_drawn=false"
```

Official live contract and documentation:

- OpenAPI 3.1: https://api.naturalproducts.net/latest/openapi.json
- Swagger UI: https://api.naturalproducts.net/latest/docs

## Response Handling

The OpenAPI schema currently declares:

```json
{
  "message": "Success",
  "reference": "string",
  "smiles": "string"
}
```

The live service returned this shape during verification:

```json
{
  "reference": null,
  "smiles": ["CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O", "[Cr]"]
}
```

Therefore clients must accept `smiles` as either a string or a list of strings, and `reference` as a string or null. The extra `[Cr]` prediction came from a labeled aspirin test image and demonstrates that segmentation can produce false-positive candidates. RDKit validity is necessary but not sufficient for accepting a result.

The skill client normalizes output to:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "source": "Steinbeck Lab Cheminformatics API / DECIMER",
  "structures": [
    {
      "index": 1,
      "smiles": "...",
      "valid": true,
      "formula": "...",
      "molecular_weight": 0.0
    }
  ],
  "warnings": []
}
```

## Skill Usage

Use the MCP tool `extract_structures_via_decimer_api`. Its generated, authoritative
signature is in [mcp-signatures.md](mcp-signatures.md); this guide maintains only the
privacy decisions and failure behavior.

Call with `confirm_upload=false` first. The MCP wrapper refuses the upload and returns
an `ok=false` result containing a `preflight` object with the resolved local path, byte
size, SHA-256 digest, decoded format and MIME type, dimensions, pixel count, hand-drawn
flag, and upload origin. Direct Python calls raise `DecimerUploadRefused` with the same
preflight available on the exception.

After authorization, set `confirm_upload=true`. The exact built-in endpoint needs no
additional origin argument. `approved_sha256`, when supplied, must match the exact bytes
used to build the upload. Any custom `DECIMER_API_URL`, including another path on the
default origin, additionally requires `approved_origin` to match its canonical HTTPS
origin.

The CLI equivalent is:

```powershell
$codexHome = if ($env:CODEX_HOME) { $env:CODEX_HOME } else { Join-Path $HOME '.codex' }
$skillRoot = Join-Path $codexHome 'skills\chemdraw'
$runtime = & python (Join-Path $skillRoot 'scripts\runtime_discovery.py') --json |
  ConvertFrom-Json
& $runtime.python.path (Join-Path $runtime.skill_root.path 'scripts\decimer_api.py') `
  C:\path\to\structure.png `
  --confirm-upload `
  --approved-sha256 <digest> `
  --approved-origin https://custom.example
```

Omit `--approved-origin` only for the exact built-in endpoint. Omitting
`--confirm-upload` prints a refusal result with preflight metadata and performs no
network request.

Environment overrides:

- `DECIMER_API_URL`: custom API endpoint; defaults to the official upload endpoint above. It must use HTTPS, contain no URL userinfo, query, or fragment, and its canonical origin must be supplied as `approved_origin`.
- `DECIMER_API_MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`: local upload-size guard; defaults to 25 MiB.
- `DECIMER_API_MAX_IMAGE_PIXELS`: decoded pixel-count guard; defaults to 40,000,000 pixels.
- `DECIMER_API_MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES`: response-size guard; defaults to 2 MiB.

## Boundaries

- Remote use uploads the image to a third-party server. Obtain explicit user authorization for the specific image or task.
- Before reading image contents, the client stats the file and rejects oversized or non-regular inputs. The read itself is also bounded so file growth cannot bypass the byte limit.
- The client decodes the exact selected bytes through `BytesIO`, checks dimensions and the configured pixel cap before full image loading, treats Pillow decompression-bomb warnings as errors, and derives MIME from the decoded format rather than the filename extension.
- Only same-origin HTTPS redirects are followed. HTTPS downgrades, cross-origin redirects, and a mismatched or downgraded final response URL are rejected.
- Normal and HTTP-error response reads are bounded. Custom endpoint metadata is reduced to its approved origin, and URL credentials, paths, and query values are not echoed in transport or response errors.
- JSON output uses an atomic same-directory install that refuses existing or race-created destinations. The serialized file is the same result object returned to the caller.
- The public contract does not state a rate limit or retention guarantee. Do not infer either.
- `https://decimer.ai` is a CSRF-protected Laravel web application, not the REST endpoint used here. Its current official source has no DECIMER route in `routes/api.php`.
- The `/latest` alias can change with future deployments. Re-read the live OpenAPI document when requests begin failing or response fields change.
